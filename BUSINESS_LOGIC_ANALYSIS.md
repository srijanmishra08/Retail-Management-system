## 🔗 The CODE-BASED LINKING SYSTEM

### Why Code-Based Architecture?

The fertilizer supply chain involves:
- **Multiple companies** sending rakes
- **Multiple products** (Urea, DAP, NPK, etc.)
- **Multiple warehouses** storing stock
- **Multiple customers** (Dealers, Retailers, Government)
- **Multiple trucks** transporting goods

**Solution:** Every entity gets a unique code, and all transactions link back to the **Rake Code (RK-CODE)**.

## 🎭 4-Role System with Specific Responsibilities

### Role 1: ADMIN (System Manager)

**Primary Function:** System foundation and oversight

**Responsibilities:**
1. **Create Rakes** (FOUNDATION OF ENTIRE SYSTEM)
   - Input: Company, Product, RR Quantity, Rake Point, Date
   - Output: Unique Rake Code (e.g., RK-2023-001)
   - Critical: ALL downstream operations link to this code

2. **Manage Master Data**
   - Add/Edit Accounts (Dealers, Retailers, Companies)
   - Add/Edit Warehouses
   - Manage user accounts

3. **View Summary Reports**
   - Rake-wise balance (RR Quantity vs Stock IN/OUT)
   - Overall system health
   - Financial summaries

**Key Point:** Admin creates the "root" entities that others reference.

---

### Role 2: RAKE POINT (Distribution Manager)

**Primary Function:** Handle incoming rake and create distribution documents

**Responsibilities:**

#### 2A. Create Builty (Transportation Document)
**When:** Truck is being loaded at rake point for transport

**Process:**
1. Select Rake Code (dropdown) → Auto-fills:
   - Rake Point Name
   - Goods Name (from rake's product)
   - Company info (reference)

2. Fill 14 Mandatory Fields:
   - Date
   - Rake Point Name (auto)
   - Account/Warehouse (destination)
   - Truck Number
   - Loading Point
   - Unloading Point
   - Truck Driver + Mobile
   - Truck Owner + Mobile
   - Goods Name (auto)
   - Number of Bags
   - Quantity (MT)
   - Freight Details
   - LR Number

3. System Generates:
   - Builty Number: BLT-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS
   - Calculates: kg/bag, rate/MT
   - Links to: Selected Rake Code

**Two Builty Types:**
- **Type A: Warehouse-bound** → Goes to warehouse for storage
- **Type B: Market Dispatch** → Direct delivery to customer

#### 2B. Create Loading Slip (Loading Record)
**When:** Recording rake wagon-wise unloading

**Purpose:** Track which wagon, which truck, how much loaded

**Fields:**
- Rake Code (link to rake)
- Serial Number (sequential)
- Loading Point & Destination
- Account (customer)
- Quantity (bags & MT)
- Truck Number & Wagon Number
- Can link to Builty (optional)

**Difference from Builty:**
- Loading Slip = Internal rake unloading record
- Builty = Transportation document for truck

**Workflow Example:**
```
Rake RK-2023-001 arrives with 10 wagons
↓
Create Loading Slip #1: Wagon 1 → Truck 1 → 50 MT → Account A
Create Loading Slip #2: Wagon 2 → Truck 2 → 50 MT → Account B
...
↓
Create Builty for Truck 1 → Links to Loading Slip #1
Create Builty for Truck 2 → Links to Loading Slip #2
```

---

### Role 3: WAREHOUSE (Stock Manager)

**Primary Function:** Manage physical stock in/out of warehouses

**Critical Understanding:** Warehouse operates on **two different builty types**:
- **Stock IN:** Uses builty created by Rake Point
- **Stock OUT:** Creates NEW builty for outgoing dispatch

#### 3A. Stock IN (Receiving Goods)

**When:** Truck arrives at warehouse with goods from rake point

**Process:**
1. Select Builty Number (from dropdown)
   - System shows: Builty details, Account, Rake Code
   - Auto-fills: Account Name

2. Enter Actual Details:
   - Unloaded Quantity (may differ from builty due to shortages)
   - Unloader Employee Name
   - Warehouse Name
   - Stock IN Date
   - Remarks (optional)

3. **CRITICAL VALIDATION** (New feature):
   ```
   IF (Total Stock IN for this Builty) > (Builty's original quantity):
       REJECT with error message
       Show: "Builty has only X.XX MT remaining"
   ELSE:
       ACCEPT and record Stock IN
       Show: "Remaining capacity: X.XX MT"
   ```

**Why this matters:** Prevents duplicate entries that inflate stock levels

**Example:**
```
Builty BLT-001: Quantity = 25 MT
↓
Stock IN #1: 10 MT → ✓ Accepted (15 MT remaining)
Stock IN #2: 10 MT → ✓ Accepted (5 MT remaining)
Stock IN #3: 10 MT → ✗ REJECTED (only 5 MT remaining)
Stock IN #3: 5 MT → ✓ Accepted (0 MT remaining)
Stock IN #4: 1 MT → ✗ REJECTED (builty fully stocked)
```

#### 3B. Stock OUT (Dispatching Goods)

**When:** Customer order fulfilled from warehouse

**Process:**
1. Select Warehouse Name
2. Select Stock OUT Date
3. **Create COMPLETE NEW BUILTY** (14 fields again!)
   - System auto-generates: BLTO-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS
   - Fill all 14 fields (like Rake Point builty)
   - System links to original Rake Code (from warehouse history)

4. **CRITICAL VALIDATION**:
   ```
   Check warehouse balance:
   IF (Requested Quantity) > (Available Stock):
       REJECT with error message
   ELSE:
       Create new builty
       Record Stock OUT
       Deduct from warehouse balance
   ```

**Why NEW builty for Stock OUT?**
- Stock OUT is a **new transportation event**
- Different truck, driver, destination, freight
- Needs complete documentation for accountability
- But still traces back to original Rake Code

**Example Flow:**
```
Warehouse 1 Balance: 50 MT (from 2 builties of RK-2023-001)
↓
Customer order: 15 MT to Dealer A
↓
Create new Builty: BLTO-20231010-103045
  Truck: GJ-05-CD-5678
  Destination: Dealer A Address
  Quantity: 15 MT
  Freight: ₹7,500
  Linked to: RK-2023-001 (auto-detected from warehouse stock)
↓
Record Stock OUT: 15 MT
New Balance: 35 MT
```

#### 3C. View Balance

**Shows:**
- **By Warehouse:** Each warehouse's stock IN/OUT/Balance
- **By Account:** Stock distributed to each customer
- **Overall Totals:** System-wide balance

---

### Role 4: ACCOUNTANT (Financial Manager)

**Primary Function:** Generate bills and manage payments

#### 4A. Create E-Bill

**When:** After goods dispatched (from builty)

**Process:**
1. Select Builty (dropdown shows pending builties)
   - System displays: Complete builty details
   - Shows: Rake → Company → Product chain

2. Fill E-Bill Details:
   - E-Bill Number (auto or manual)
   - E-Bill Date
   - Amount (₹)
   - Tax Amount (optional)
   - Description

3. **Upload Eway Bill** (Government requirement):
   - Eway Bill Number
   - Upload PDF (max 5MB)
   - Status: Uploaded/Pending

**Complete Traceability:**
```
E-Bill EB-2023-001
  ↓
Builty BLTO-20231010-103045
  ↓
Warehouse Stock (15 MT dispatched)
  ↓
Original Builty BLT-20231008-143022
  ↓
Rake RK-2023-001
  ↓
ABC Fertilizers, Urea, 500 MT
```

#### 4B. View All E-Bills

**Features:**
- Filter by date range
- Filter by status (Uploaded/Pending)
- View/Print e-bill
- Upload eway bill if pending
- View PDF if uploaded

## 🔍 Critical Validations & Business Rules

### Validation 1: Stock IN Capacity Check
**Rule:** Cannot stock IN more than builty's original quantity

```python
# Pseudo-code
builty_quantity = GET builty.quantity_mt WHERE builty_number = X
existing_stock_in = SUM(warehouse_stock.quantity_mt) 
                    WHERE builty_id = X AND transaction_type = 'IN'

IF (existing_stock_in + new_quantity) > builty_quantity:
    REJECT: "Builty has only (builty_quantity - existing_stock_in) MT remaining"
ELSE:
    ACCEPT: Record Stock IN
    SHOW: "Remaining capacity: (builty_quantity - existing_stock_in - new_quantity) MT"
```

**Why:** Prevents duplicate Stock IN entries that inflate warehouse balance

---

### Validation 2: Stock OUT Balance Check
**Rule:** Cannot dispatch more than warehouse has

```python
# Pseudo-code
warehouse_balance = SUM(quantity_mt WHERE transaction_type='IN') 
                  - SUM(quantity_mt WHERE transaction_type='OUT')

IF requested_quantity > warehouse_balance:
    REJECT: "Warehouse has only {warehouse_balance} MT available"
ELSE:
    ACCEPT: Create new builty, record Stock OUT
```

**Why:** Prevents negative stock (impossible in real warehouse)

---

### Validation 3: Rake Quantity Balance
**Rule:** Total distribution cannot exceed RR quantity

```python
# Pseudo-code (Admin summary)
rake_rr_quantity = GET rakes.rr_quantity WHERE rake_code = X

total_builties = SUM(builty.quantity_mt) WHERE rake_code = X

IF total_builties > rake_rr_quantity:
    WARNING: "Rake over-distributed by {difference} MT"
```

**Why:** Detects data entry errors or fraud

---

### Validation 4: E-Bill Uniqueness
**Rule:** One builty = One e-bill (no duplicates)

```python
# Pseudo-code
existing_ebill = GET ebills WHERE builty_id = X

IF existing_ebill EXISTS:
    REJECT: "E-Bill already exists for this builty"
ELSE:
    ACCEPT: Create new e-bill
```

**Why:** Prevents double billing

---

## 📈 Reports & Analytics

### Report 1: Admin Rake Summary
**Shows:**
```
Rake Code | Company | Date | RR Quantity | Stock IN | Stock OUT | Balance
RK-001    | ABC Ltd | 01-Oct | 500 MT    | 480 MT   | 200 MT    | 280 MT
RK-002    | XYZ Ltd | 05-Oct | 300 MT    | 300 MT   | 300 MT    | 0 MT
```

**Calculation:**
- Stock IN = SUM(warehouse_stock.quantity_mt WHERE builty.rake_code = X AND transaction_type='IN')
- Stock OUT = SUM(warehouse_stock.quantity_mt WHERE builty.rake_code = X AND transaction_type='OUT')
- Balance = RR Quantity - Stock IN + Stock OUT (if warehouse model)

---

### Report 2: Warehouse Balance
**Shows:**
```
Warehouse | Location | Stock IN | Stock OUT | Balance
WH-1      | Loc-A    | 250 MT   | 100 MT    | 150 MT
WH-2      | Loc-B    | 230 MT   | 50 MT     | 180 MT
WH-3      | Loc-C    | 0 MT     | 0 MT      | 0 MT
TOTAL     |          | 480 MT   | 150 MT    | 330 MT
```

---

### Report 3: Account-wise Distribution
**Shows:**

## 🚨 Current System Gaps & Future Enhancements

### Gap 1: Rent Calculation (From SRS)
**SRS Requirement:** Calculate rent for stock held in warehouse beyond threshold

**Not Yet Implemented:**
- Rent start date tracking
- Per-day per-MT rent calculation
- Automatic rent bill generation

**Needed Fields:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE warehouse_stock ADD COLUMN rent_start_date DATE;
ALTER TABLE warehouse_stock ADD COLUMN rent_rate_per_day_per_mt REAL;

CREATE TABLE rent_bills (
    rent_bill_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    stock_id INTEGER FK,
    days_stored INTEGER,
    quantity_mt REAL,
    rate_per_day_per_mt REAL,
    total_rent REAL,
    bill_date DATE
);
```

---

### Gap 2: Lifting Charges (From SRS)
**SRS Requirement:** Charge for labor/equipment when stock dispatched

**Not Yet Implemented:**
- Lifting charge per MT
- Automatic calculation during Stock OUT

**Needed Fields:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE warehouse_stock ADD COLUMN lifting_charges REAL;
```

---

### Gap 3: Market Dispatch without Warehouse
**Partially Implemented:**
- Builty can go to account_id (direct delivery)
- But no separate "market dispatch" table

**Enhancement Needed:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE market_dispatches (
    dispatch_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    rake_code TEXT FK,
    builty_id INTEGER FK,
    dispatch_type TEXT, -- 'Direct' or 'Warehouse'
    dispatch_date DATE,
    destination TEXT,
    quantity_mt REAL,
    transportation_bill_amount REAL
);
```

---

### Gap 4: Loading Slip → Builty Linking
**Current State:** Optional link exists but not enforced

**Enhancement:** 
- One loading slip → One builty (mandatory)
- Prevent builty creation without loading slip
- Auto-fill builty from loading slip

---

### Gap 5: Truck Tracking
**Current State:** Truck table exists but underutilized

**Enhancement:**
- Track truck trips
- Calculate truck utilization
- Truck maintenance records

---

### Gap 6: Stock Aging Report
**Missing Feature:** Show how long stock has been in warehouse

**Needed Query:**
```sql
SELECT 
    warehouse_name,
    builty_number,
    quantity_mt,
    stock_in_date,
    JULIANDAY('now') - JULIANDAY(stock_in_date) as days_in_storage
FROM warehouse_stock
WHERE transaction_type = 'IN' 
  AND stock_id NOT IN (
      SELECT DISTINCT builty_id 
      FROM warehouse_stock 
      WHERE transaction_type = 'OUT'
  )
ORDER BY days_in_storage DESC;
```

## 🎯 System Strengths

### ✅ Strength 1: Complete Traceability
Every transaction traces back to original rake:
```
E-Bill → Builty → Warehouse Stock → Original Builty → Rake → Company
```

### ✅ Strength 2: Role-Based Security
Each user sees only their relevant functions:
- Admin: Strategic view
- RakePoint: Operational entry
- Warehouse: Stock management
- Accountant: Financial tracking

### ✅ Strength 3: Flexible Distribution
Supports multiple business models:
- Warehouse storage → Market dispatch
- Direct market dispatch (bypass warehouse)
- Mixed distribution

### ✅ Strength 4: Data Validation
Built-in checks prevent:
- Duplicate stock entries
- Negative warehouse balance
- Over-distribution beyond rake capacity
- Double billing

### ✅ Strength 5: Audit Trail
Every transaction timestamped and user-attributed:
- Who created what, when
- Complete history maintained
- No silent updates/deletes
