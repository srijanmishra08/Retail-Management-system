### For

## **Fertilizer Inventory Management System (FIMS)**

---

## **1. Introduction**

### **1.1 Purpose**

The system manages the **flow of material** from the **Rake Point** to multiple **Warehouses**, and from there to **Dealers**, **Government departments**, and **Payal Fertilizers (own company)**.
It automates **inventory tracking, dispatch, billing, and rent/lifting charge calculations** for an end-to-end supply chain of fertilizers.

The system handles:

* Management of **rake unloading** and **distribution**.
* **Stock monitoring** across **three warehouses** and one **rake point**.
* **Dispatch management** to dealers, own company, or government.
* **Billing system** for transportation, rent, and lifting charges.
* **Automated reports** for monthly dispatches, warehouse stock, and pending bills.

The goal is to ensure **accurate, real-time visibility** of fertilizer stock and simplify coordination between **suppliers, warehouse operators, dispatchers, and managers**.
